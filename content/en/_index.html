            <h3><a href="/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/">Kubernetes</a> is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</h3>
            <p>It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds
            upon <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2898444">15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google</a>,
            combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.</p>
